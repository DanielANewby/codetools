Licensing is hard...

The codeTools libraries and original source are, for the most part, licensed
under the MIT license, a copy of which should be included in the package you've
downloaded as `MIT-LICENSE'. Some portions or files of the source for codeTools
fall under different license, often public domain, occaisionally a custom
license (Hseih's hash for example).

All sources originating under other licenses will have their originating license
and attribution in the header of the pertaining files. Refer to individual
source files for licensing information.

A good faith attempt to guarantee compatibility with the MIT license has been
made by the library authors. Please let us know if there are any conflicts that
we are not aware of.

Wondabyne is a suburb located in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia, and is part of the Central Coast Council local government area.
Wondabyne railway station, is serviced by NSW Trainlink services to Newcastle and Central on the Main North railway line and is adjacent to a wharf on Mullet Creek, a tributary estuary of the Hawkesbury River. The train station has a very short platform, which is long enough to hold only around one train door.[1]
Due to the rugged terrain of the area, Wondabyne station does not have road access.[1] It has been suggested that it may be the only station in Australia that does not have road access. The station relies on water access for residents across Mullet Creek, via a pontoon and walkway.
For railway buffs Wondabyne Railway Station is interesting for its isolation, very short platform - less than one carriage (exit via rear door of the last carriage) - and the fact that it is fully equipped (except for staff) with announcements of coming trains, signage, seats and shelters on both platforms, boom-gates and bells to protect those crossing the tracks and even an Opalcard validation unit.
